# Splash!

Splash is a cross-platform application to help you find a place to cool off 
in the summer sun.

# Motivation

Splash is a descendant of the original Dowsing application  which started as an 
Open Hamilton project to help citizens in Hamilton find water spots in the city.
Since the code for Dowsing was hastily put together and not built with future 
extensibility in mind a new foundation is being laid.

With Splash we hope to build something even more useful and extendable than what 
we had started with Dowsing.  The goal for Splash is to build a suite of 
cross-platform applications that will be readily extensible for any other 
municipalities that wish to use it.
